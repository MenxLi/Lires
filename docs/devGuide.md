## Naming convention
**Python**
Alough [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) suggests use `lower_case_with_underscores` for methods and functions...  

By my personal preference, I use the following naming rules: 
- `snake_case` (Lowercase / Lower case with underscore) for variables, properties
- `lowerCamelCase` (Mixed case) for functions, methods
- `UpperCamelCase` (Pascal case) for classes

**Please follow this style if you are working on this repository**, these naming makes it very clear to distinguish between different types of code.

**Javascript**   
I follow Javascript naming convention, which is:
- `lowerCamelCase` for variables, properties, functions and methods.
- `UpperCamelCase` for classes.
