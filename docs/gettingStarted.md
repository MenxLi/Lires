## Introduction

The name of Lires is a combination of **Lire** and **Res**earch, where **Lire** is the French word for '***Read***'.

![LiresWeb-GUI](https://limengxun-imagebed.oss-cn-wuhan-lr.aliyuncs.com/liresweb1.1.3v0.png)

Lires is designed to be deployed onto a server to provide a **self-hosted collaborative solution** for research literature management.

The software mainly consists of four modules:  
1. `lires`, the global resource module.
2. `lires-server`, the main entry point for the client.
3. `lires-service`, microservices for enhanced scalability. 
4. `lires-web`, a web-based interface for user interaction.

## Quick Start

```sh
pip install 'Lires[all]'
lrs-user add <username> <password> --admin
lrs-cluster -i ~/.Lires/cluster-config.yaml
```


## Manual Deployment

### Installation from source
Compile frontend files
> **Prerequisites:**  Node.js
```bash
cd lires_web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```
Install the servers
> **Prerequisites:**  Python 3.8+, GCC
```bash
pip install ".[all]"
```

### Server startup

#### Basic entries
**Start the Lires:**
```bash
lires server
```
Lires is a tornado server that provides API for the client (WebUI & CLI) to communicate with.

**Start the LiresAI:**
```bash
lires ai
```
The LiresAI server is written with FastAPI, it provides additional AI features and is designed to be connected by the Lires server, so that the latter can provide AI features to the client.  

> <details> 
> <summary>The reason to separate LiresAI server from Lires server</summary>  
> - AI features may require more resources, so that the ai server can be deployed on a more powerful machine. If the user does not need AI features, there is no need to start the ai server and install the heavy AI dependencies.  <br>
> - Allocating resources to the ai server and Lires server separately can be more flexible. For example, the ai server may need more GPU memory, we can launch multiple Lires servers pointing to different `$LRS_HOME`, while sharing the same ai server. <br>
> -  It is also possible that the ai server needs a proxy to access the internet, while the Lires server does not.   
</details>

#### More on starting the servers
`$LRS_HOME` directory is used for application data storage, by default it is set to `~/.Lires`.  
The data directory contains the configuration file, log files, default database, LiresWeb backend data, cache files...  

To start the application with arbitrary data directory, you can run: 
```bash
LRS_HOME="your/path/here" lires ...
```
Typically, the lires server can be started by binding a different port to each database and providing services to different users. Which can be achieved by setting the `$LRS_HOME` variable.  

Additionally, various environment variables can be set to customize the behavior of the application. 
A detailed list of environment variables can be found at **[here](./enviromentVariables.md)**.

Thus a more general command to start the server is:
```sh
LRS_HOME="your/path/here" LRS_SSL_CERTFILE="your/cert/file" LRS_SSL_KEYFILE="your/key/file" lires server -p <port>
```

---

### Cluster startup
It will be laborious and error-prone to start multiple servers manually.  
Especially when we want to start multiple servers with different configurations.  

Instead, we provide a simple script to enable server clustering for easy deployment.  
```sh
# Generate a template configuration file
lrs-cluster <your/configuration.yaml> --generate

# Edit the configuration file
# ...

# Start the cluster
lrs-cluster <your/configuration.yaml>
```
The configuration file designates the environment variables, as well as the command line arguments for each server.

---

### On the first run
**On the first run** you need to create a user account, which can be done by running the `lrs-user` command in the container.
```sh
# export LRS_HOME="..."
lrs-user add <username> <password> --admin
```
After the user is created, you can manage other users with this user via the web interface.

---
## Docker Deployment
Instead of installing the server, you can also deploy the server using docker.  
Which adds additional security and building efficiency.  

### Method 1 - Use docker compose (recommended)
**Nvidia container toolkit should be installed**
```sh
docker compose up
```

### Method 2 - Use the cluster image
If you don't have an Nvidia GPU, or you want more flexibility, you can use the cluster image.
```sh
# creates a docker image named lires
docker build -f ./docker/cluster.Dockerfile -t lires:latest .

# create the container named 'lrs', 
# please change the port mapping and volume mapping as needed
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v $HOME/.Lires:/root/.Lires --name lrs lires:latest
```

The container runs server cluster with configuration at `/root/.Lires/container-cluster-config.yaml` (Which should be mounted to the host).  
You can edit the configuration file to change the server settings.

**To maximize the compatibility, The container image by default does not use GPU for AI features.**  

### On the first run
The same as manual deployment, you need to add a user account on the first run. 
The user information will be stored in the volume mapping directory, so that they will not be lost when the container is removed.
```sh
docker exec lrs lrs-user add <username> <password> --admin
```

---

## Management
There are several management tools for the server, they are all accessible by `lrs-<tool_name>`.  
A detailed description of each tool can be found in [manage.md](./manage.md).

Following are some common management tasks.
### User management
After installation, user should be registered with `lrs-user` command.
```sh
lrs-user add <username> <password>
```
Or you want to change the password, admin status, or tag permisson of a user, run:
```sh
lrs-user update <username> -p <password> -t "tag1" "tag2->subtag" --admin true
```
for more information, see `lrs-user -h`.  

### Build search index
The search index is used for **semantic search** and querying **related works**,
It is currently implemented as building feature vectors for each entry (thanks to [huggingface transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)), 
and use cosine similarity to measure the distance between vectors.

**No need to manually build the index**, the index will be periodically updated by the server.   
If you add a document and want to update the index immediately, or you want to use LLM to summarize all the no-absract entries for indexing, you can run:
```sh
lrs-index build
```
**This requires LiresAI server to be running.**
