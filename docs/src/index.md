<!-- ## Introduction

The name of Lires is a combination of **Lire** and **Res**earch, where **Lire** is the French word for '***Read***'.

Lires is designed to be deployed onto a server to provide a **self-hosted collaborative solution** for research literature management.

The software mainly consists of four modules:  
1. `lires`, the global resource module.
2. `lires-server`, the main entry point for the client.
3. `lires-service`, microservices for enhanced scalability. 
4. `lires-web`, a web-based interface for user interaction.
