// From chatgpt:
// In Vue 3 with TypeScript, you should have a shims-vue.d.ts file (or similar) in your project, which will tell TypeScript about the types of Vue components. Here's an example of what that file might look like:
// The `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface is being defined here, and any string can be used as a JSX/TSX element. This is a very basic setup and you might want to replace `any` with a more specific type if you know what attributes your components are going to receive.
// Make sure the `shims-vue.d.ts` file is included in the `include` array, so TypeScript will use it for type checking.

declare module '*.vue' {
    import { DefineComponent } from 'vue'
    const component: DefineComponent<{}, {}, any>
    export default component
}

declare namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
        [elem: string]: any
    }
}
